# Guarding-Against-Keylogger

A keylogger is a type of software or script that records keystrokes on a computer or device. While
keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes such as monitoring computer activity for security reasons
or parental control, they are often associated with malicious intent, such as stealing passwords or sensitive
information. In this abstract, we will explore the concept of creating a basic keylogger using JavaScript,
which can capture keystrokes within a web browser environment. JavaScript, typically utilized for
enhancing interactivity on web pages, can also be leveraged to capture user input events, including
keystrokes. This aims to provide a comprehensive solution for keylogger detection and prevention. It will
employ different techniques to identify and detect keylogging attempts. There are several techniques that
can be used to detect keyloggers and protect against them. We will be using the browserâ€™s developer tools
to detect the Keylogger. The objectives of this project is :

1. Explain the process of attack.
2. How we detect the attack.
3. Showing a alert when attack is performed



## Pre - Requirements

1. Download the Apache Xampp Server from the following link:
    https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

2. Download the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from the link:
    https://code.visualstudio.com/download
## How to Run

After installation of all the pre-requirements, Open "htdocs" folder in the xampp server folder and create a folder named "admin-login". Now keep all the code in that folder.

Run xampp server as "admin" and start the server.

Go to your Browser and type : "local/admin-login".
